// Sub-documents in the local checkout.
//
// A sub-document is a document that belongs to another document rather than to
// a folder. On the server it is addressed by a reserved folder path,
// "_sub/<parent uid>" (see server/router/api/v1/subdoc.go). Mirroring that path
// literally would give the checkout a tree of uid-named directories, which is
// unreadable to the humans and agents the local tree exists for — so it is
// mapped to a folder sitting beside the parent's own file:
//
//	notes/Architecture.md
//	notes/Architecture.subdocs/Failure modes.md
//
// The mapping is one-to-one in both directions: pull computes the local path
// from the parent's, and push recovers "_sub/<parent uid>" from the ".subdocs"
// folder by looking up which document the neighbouring file is.
//
// Requirements: docs/dev/requirements/knowledge-base/sub-documents.md.
